Topic: **Program Synthesis**

## What this paper is about?

A method of using neural networks to predict the probability that certain functions (from DSL) appear in a program satisfying a set of given input-output constraints. These probabilities are then used to optimize the search for the program satisfying the input-output constraints.

## DSL

### First Order Functions

Head, Last, Take, Drop, ...

### Higher Order Functions

Map, Filter, ...
