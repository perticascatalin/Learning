# The Diversity in Computer Vision

Most Computer Vision courses for undergraduate or graduate students usually contain an introductory lecture, during which a list of topics and applications specific to this field are presented. However, most instructors never look beyond their own field of research, which is great because they don't have to talk about things which they don't know so well. On the other hand, students' interest in this field diminishes because they are not aware of the wide variety of aspects which might prove fascinating.

No matter what we learn, I find it very useful to start with a clear overview of the subject. Therefore I find it important to explain the end results and the practical applications in this field, as they arouse curiosity regarding further problem solving.

# Areas of applications

## Medical Systems

Medical image analysis is a vast field of research, with a great number of practical applications in diagnosis and therapy. This is great to do research on if you have a general interest in biology, human anatomy and/or medicine.

### Brain

A machine learning model trained with brain images can configure itself to detect and highlight **tumors**, **lesions** and other **anomalies**. It can also correlate brain activity to behaviour, an essential task when trying to understand neurological disorders. The correlations made can be used to predict future states of the brain. An interesting practical application would be for instance to predict **seizures** in epileptic patients. What types of data can be used there? Both still images (scans) and time series (data showing development) are currently being used in machine learning. Below you can find collages made of frequently used types of scans.

> MRIs are generated by interpreting radio waves in the presence of a magnetic field. This method of acquiring images produces highly accurate images and therefore it is used in brain scans. 

### Body

Making a computer learn to imitate certain tasks humans perform, such as labeling or outlining a region of interest in medical images, can be achieved by collecting many slightly **different subjects/samples** of a certain type of **data**, like human body scans for instance. 

**A compilation of CT (computed tomography) scans**

> CTs are generated by reconstructing a 3D photo of the subject from computer-processed X-rays.

### Better than human performance

An automatic detector and classifier for different structures such as nerves, vessels and bones has the potential advantage of being **faster** and **more precise** than a human at the same task. This is especially helpful when **risk structures** are involved. 

**Radiotherapy planning**  

![alt](http://www.weheartcv.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/radio_therapy-e1421544951909.jpg)

Applying **radiotherapy** to patients with **cancer** is such a risk situation. 
A computer-assisted system can be used to plan radiation dosages for each part of the body (through beams), but if important nerves are irradiated, they can suffer irreparable damage. Thus, automatically identifying the regions of the body to be avoided can save a specialist plenty of time spent in carefully annotating scans. 

**Computer-assisted surgery**

Another such example are **surgeries** where extreme human precision is required or preferred. Computers can perform **neurosurgeries**, help **implant** and apply different other procedures to the body, better than humans can do provided they have knowledege about the space where they operate. This is where **automatic labelling** comes in handy. 

### Bone structures

!!! add image with bones !!

This core set of parts from our body is probably the most **visible** in any type of medical scans. The process of automatically labeling the bones is thus easier than the process required to label many other structures. But labeling bones can also make it easier to label structures like **nerves** or **vessels**. This happens because it provides the machine with a **map of the body**. And everything is easier to search for with a map, even for a computer.

**Segmented and labeled CT scans**

In case you are wondering what features could be used to distinguish between different types of bones, feel free to go through this [post](http://www.weheartcv.com/features-bone-structures-classification/) where I made a list of the features and explained why they work.

### Different levels of complexity

Sometimes the process of labeling a certain part of the body can prove very tedious. 

Such a situation would be labeling a structure which is hardly visible in scans. Directly attempting to detect it could either be too slow because of the vast search space or it could provide low accuracy results.

However, its location and boundaries could be deducted from its context (surrounding or nearby parts which are visible). This would require labeling some other relevant parts first and then fitting a template of the part we want to label in the area confined by the surrounding structures.

This usually holds true for images with compound structure and high enough resolution. On small images (simple representations) machines don't need very complex models in order to learn to distinguish between different objects.

### Blood and Vessels

The subjects for learning can also be different types of cells in the blood or the more important blood vessels. These two tasks are however slightly different. Blood cells appear in great numbers, their shape is fairly simple, but varies more in time, while

**Subjects to identify**

- morphological operations highly used for preprocessing.
- color - not necessarily BGR
- eigenvectors, eigenvalues
- watershed and connected components

- monocytes, lymphocytes, neutrophils

- investigate for 1-2 hours
- compile images in 1/2
- find features for those
- how vessles can be found -> again CT, 
- blood cells have other features

- talk about how the types of features change if ....
- insert idea with handmade vs. learned features

### Liver and Lungs

- features
- images
- some other idea, maybe matching, as well as machine learning techniques -> Decision Trees - Random forests -> models our decision making process -> imagine
