T1: 2SAT, CNF
	- transformation x0 v x1 into -xo -> x1 or -x1 -> xo
	- implication graph (ref. constraint graph)
	- strongly connected component

	https://infoarena.ro/problema/2sat (incl. coloring map problem)
Abstract:
	Solve 2SAT using graph algorithms. Reduce various problems to solving 2SAT.

T2: Zvon/Pandemic
	- probability/graphs related problem
	- markov chain/probability graph/transition matrix
	- strongly connected component
	- counting problem/solve standard linear eq. system
	- potentially a good toy problem to research consistency
Abstract:
	Given a network of people with nodes as people and edges representing the probability to pass on a rumour, identify the probability for any person to find out the rumour given a starting node.

T3: DeepCoder
	- ML, search, constraint solvers
	- DSL, program synthesis

Abstract:
	Using a DSL for writing problems working on simple arrays. Search for a program which satisfies input-output examples.

T5: A backtracking problem
	- N Queens
	- Map Coloring
	- Timetable
Abstract: TODO

T6: Multiple divisions awarding
	- backtracking
	- constraints
	- tricky problem once we dive into details
Abstract: Members of a tournament participate in several divisions, each with its prizes. Find an optimal way to distribute the prizes such that a member only receives prizes from one division, whichever is more favorable.
