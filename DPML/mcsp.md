# Constraint Programming applied to Music: Report

### Abstract

### Goals

- Briefly look over music theory to understand how musical patterns are represented
- Investigate combinatorial problems resulting from modelling musical patterns as CSPs
- Experimental part left as future work

## 1. Introduction

## 2. The Basics in Music Theory

## 3. Modelling Musical Patterns through Constraint Programming

## 4. Conclusion
