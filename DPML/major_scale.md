# The Major Scale

## 0. Questions

- what do you call `A, B, C, D, E, F, G` vs `A#, C#, D#, F#, G#`?

## 1. Definitions and Examples

### 1.0 Scale definition

A scale is a ladder built on top of musical notes, which adheres to a sequential pattern of distances defined between 2 adjacent notes on the scale.

### 1.1 Major scale pattern

The major scale is a tonal (musical notes) progression which starts on a tonic position and traverses an octave (6 tones) in the following progression: `T T S T T T S` (then repeat pattern, `T = tone`, `S = semitone`).

For instance, the C Major scale: `C D E_F G A B_C`

- C-D: T
- D-E: T
- E-F: S
- F-G: T
- G-A: T
- A-B: T
- B-C: S

### 1.2 Octave definition

In an octave, there are 12 semitones:

- 7 diationic semitones (`C D E F G A B`)
- 5 chromatic semitones (`C# D# F# G# A#`)

It is important to note that the C Major scale does not contain chromatic semitones.

### 1.3 Transposition of the major scale

However, if we analyze the D Major scale (1 tone higher than C Major), we will notice the following pattern: `D E F# G A B C# D` (this is because we need to adhere to the TTSTTTS rule for creating the major scale pattern). Eg. Going from E 1 tone up (the second T in TTSTTS, will require us to jump S(E-F)+ S (F-F#) = T, going from E to F#). Here we have 2 chromatic semitones: F# and C#. 

- D-E: T
- E-F#: T
- F#-G: S
- G-A: T
- A-B: T
- B-C#: T
- C#-D: S
