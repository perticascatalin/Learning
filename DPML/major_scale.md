# The Major Scale

## 0. Questions

- what do you call `A, B, C, D, E, F, G` vs `A#, C#, D#, F#, G#`?

## 1. Definitions and Examples

### 1.1 Scale definition

A scale is a ladder built on top of musical notes, which adheres to a sequential pattern of distances defined between 2 adjacent notes on the scale.

### 1.2 Major scale pattern

The major scale is a tonal (musical notes) progression which starts on a tonic position and traverses an octave (6 tones) in the following progression: `T T S T T T S` (then repeat pattern, `T = tone`, `S = semitone`).

For instance, the C Major scale: `C D E_F G A B_C`

- C-D: T
- D-E: T
- E-F: S
- F-G: T
- G-A: T
- A-B: T
- B-C: S

### 1.3 Octave definition

In an octave, there are 12 semitones:

- 7 diationic semitones (`C D E F G A B`)
- 5 chromatic semitones (`C# D# F# G# A#`)

It is important to note that the C Major scale does not contain chromatic semitones.

### 1.4 Transposition of the major scale

However, if we analyze the D Major scale (1 tone higher than C Major), we will notice the following pattern: `D E F# G A B C# D`. This is because we need to adhere to the TTSTTTS rule for creating the major scale pattern. Eg. Going from E 1 tone up (the second T in TTSTTS, will require us to jump S(E-F)+ S (F-F#) = T, going from E to F#). Here we have 2 chromatic semitones: F# and C#. 

- D-E: T
- E-F#: T
- F#-G: S
- G-A: T
- A-B: T
- B-C#: T
- C#-D: S

## 2. Harmonization of the C Major scale

Every note in a major scale can be harmonized with a few additional notes. These notes appear in the vibration of the tonic note and they are situated on the `1st, 3rd, 5rd and 7th` step from the initial note.

### 2.1 CMaj7 chord

For instance, the note C, the first in C Major Scale can be accompanied by any note in the `CMaj7` chord: `C E G B`. These are extracted as follows:

- `C D E_F G A B_C`
- `1 2 3_4 5 6 7_1`
- **C** D **E** F **G** A **B** C
- if we extract the notes at positions `1,3,5,7` we get `C E G B`.
- we use the notation Maj7 to denote that it has a major seventh (the distance between C and B is half a tone larger than a minor seventh)
- and because it has a major third, it is a major chord (denoted by the lack of `m`)

### 2.2 Dm7 chord

- `D F A C`
- because it has a minor third, it is a minor chord (denoted by `m`)

### 2.3 Em7 chord

- `E G B D`
- because it has a minor third, it is a minor chord (denoted by `m`)

### 2.4 FMaj7 chord

- `F A C E`
- similar to CMaj7

### 2.5 G7 chord

- `G B D F`
- it is a major chord (major third) with minor seventh

### 2.6 Am7 chord

- `A C E G`
- similar to Dm7 and Em7

### 2.7 Bm7b5 chord

- `B D F A`
- the fifth is diminished (denoted by b5)

## 3. Natural order of musical notes (perfect fifth progression)

- `C G D A E B F# C# G# D# A# F C`

### 3.1 G Major

- `G A B C D E F# G`

### 3.2 D Major

- `D E F# G A B C# D`

### 3.3 A Major

- `A B C# D E F# G# A`

### 3.4 E Major

- `E F# G# A B C# D# E`

### 3.5 B Major

- `B C# D# E F# G# A# B`

### 3.6 F# Major

- `F# G# A# B C# D# F F#`

### 3.7 C# Major

- `C# D# F F# G# A# C C#`
