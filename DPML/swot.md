# Declarative Programming in Machine Learning: Final Essay

## Abstract

## Research Topics

### Queens and Knights
### Constraint Programming in Genetic Algorithms
### Constraint Satisfaction applied to Music

## Analysis

### 1. Challenges

- understanding what the course is about
- understanding the scope and purpose of the assignments
- once I selected a topic, the time to develop it and get past the exploratory phase was quite short
- finding enough good related research for the selected topics

### 2. Strengths

- learned how to formalize problem constraints in a declarative way
- applied constraint satisfaction to several domains

### 3. Weaknesses

- poor comparative analysis for the reports
- background research not so well established either
- implementing queens and knights experiments before understanding well enough the formalism required for the course
- this lead to a weaker mapping between the required methods to be applied (problem reduction, search strategies) and the experiments (implementation)

### 4. Opportunities

### 5. Threats

### 6. Impact
