# Constraint Programming in Genetic Algorithms

## Introduction

Genetic algorithms are known to be used in solving constraint satisfaction problems, such as the larger class of scheduling problems [reference]. This study is however on a different matter. As such, we attempt to model parts of a genetic algorithm using constraint programming. Later on, we'll see that both the problems of constraint satisfaction, as well as constraint optimization can be used to formalize steps in a generic genetic algorithm [reference]. Whether these models are actually useful in practice remains a matter for further research. Thus, the main goal of this study is to conduct an investigation on which parts of a genetic algorithm could be formalized using constraint programming and then speculate on the benefits of such an approach.
