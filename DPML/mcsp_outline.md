# Constraint Satisfaction in Music: Outline

### Structure & Contents

#### Section 1: Introduction:

- Lists the purpose of the study
	- 2 disciplines involved: both arts and mathematics (formal system with rules)
	- explore rules & representations in music: harmony & melody

- Provides a general idea of how music & CSP fit together
	- sequence of variables and patterns which fit a musical system
	- a lot of work on sets (scales & chords) and distances (notes & intervals)
	- start from the idea of canons construction from GEB
	- work our way up from simple rules and definitions

#### Section 2: Music Theory Background:

- Melody, Harmony, Rhythm, Bass (fundamentals showcased in How Music Works documentary)
- Representation, Musical Notes, Intervals, Scales, Chords, Arpeggios 

#### Section 3: Background on previous Research & Experiments:

- The use of software to generate or compose music (eg. by using Machine Learning)
- The relation between music, mathematics & AI in general (eg. from Goedel, Esher, Bach book)
- The potential use of CSP in modelling the canon problem (searching for the right theme overlaps)

#### Section 4: Model Musical Patterns using CSP

- Related research examples: all interval series, notes and intervals representation (4.1), constraining intervals to obtain themes (4.2), chords representation, successive chords properties and constraints (4.3, 4.4, 4.5)
- Own attempt at modelling the construction of a pop / rock song as a CSP (4.6)

#### Section 5: Conclusions

- I think solving harmony and melody problems by using search techniques would have more value than trying to compose music automatically based on training data, at least from a musical perspective
- A number of elements of music have been identified and defined as constraint satisfaction problems, in a declarative way
