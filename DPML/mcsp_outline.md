# Constraint Satisfaction in Music: Outline

### Structure & Contents

Section 1: Introduction:

- Lists the purpose of the study
- Provides a general idea of how music & CSP fit together

Section 2: Music Theory Background: 

- Melody, Harmony, Rhythm, Bass (fundamentals showcased in How Music Works documentary)
- Representation, Musical Notes, Intervals, Scales, Chords, Arpeggios 

Section 3: Background on previous Research & Experiments:

- The use of software to generate or compose music (eg. by using Machine Learning)
- The relation between music, mathematics & AI in general (eg. from Goedel, Esher, Bach book)
- The potential use of CSP in modelling the canon problem (searching for the right theme overlaps)

Section 4: Model Musical Patterns using CSP

- Related research examples: all interval series (4.1), constraining intervals to obtain themes (4.2), successive chords properties and constraints (4.3, 4.4, 4.5)
- Own attempt at modelling the construction of a rock song as a CSP (4.6)

Section 5: Conclusions

- I think solving harmony and melody problems by using search techniques would have more value than trying to compose music automatically based on training data, at least from a musical perspective
- A number of elements of music have been identified and defined as constraint satisfaction problems, in a declarative way
