# Multi-Label Classification

## Introduction

In the problem described here we look at the advantages of using the same learning model for inferring different properties of objects. For instance, we create a toy dataset with 2D shapes which can have 3 classes of colors and 3 classes of shapes. The initial problem we wanted to model was given a set of multiple choices tests written by hand, extract the chosen answer for each question in an automatic way.
